/**
 * A class which represents all possible iv combinations for a pokemon.
 * An object contains:
 * count - the amount of IV combinations the pokemon has
 * highpercent: Best case iv%
 * scannedCP: the cp scanned from the image
 * getAveragePercent: returns the average IV% of all alternativs
 * lowPercent: worst case IV%
 * low attack,defence,stamina - the value for the IV stat where the lowest % was found
 * high attack,defence,stamina - the value for hte IV stat where the highest % was found
 *
 * The ivscanresult object has evolved (bloated) to incluide several other things not needed to calculate the ivs,
 * which are used by other methods, such as the scanned hp and an identifier for the pokemon.
