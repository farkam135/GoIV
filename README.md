#What is GoIV
GoIV is an android app made for Pokemon GO that allows users to seamlessly calculate their Pokemon's IVs. GoIV does <b>not</b> interfere with Pokemon GO or their servers.

###Is there an iOS version?

No, but the application is open source, so someone else might try to recreate it in iOS. The current developers are not planning on making an iOS version.

###Why does the app fail to scan my Pokemon type?

The applicaiton scans the pokemon name to determine pokemon type, so if you've given your pokemon a nickname, it's going to fail.

###Why doesn't my arc dot line up perfectly?

If it's just a couple of pixels wrong, then it's fine. It hardly lines up 'perfectly' on any device.

Usually when the dot is misaligned, it turns out the user forgot to increment their level in the app. You can see what level the application thinks your trainer is in the notification, it it's wrong, change it in the app!

If the dot still doesn't fit, then you might have a device with an unusual resolution, and it would be good if the application was updated to accommodate that.

###Why doesn't the IV button appear?

The most common reasons are:

Screen changing apps / features such as screen tinting and dynamic brightness level.

The phone you're running has a faulty screen capture api (Seems to occasionally affect Cyanogen and some lesser known phone brands)

The application has not been granted permission to draw other other apps.

The application wasn't started.

###Does this application break Niantics terms of use?

This application is in a gray area, you could argue that the application does or does not, depending on how you interpret the wording.

###Can you get banned from Pokémon Go for using GoIV?

It's 'possible', but we don't think it will happen. Niantic could alter their app to scan for other apps running along-side it, but even if they did that, they probably wont go as far as banning users.

###Why does GoIV require X permission?

Storage:
To store the OCR module. (OCR - Optical character recognition, the thing that converts images of text to text.)

Screen capture:
To identify when to add the overlay, and to read the pokemon information.

###What are IVs?

Basically stats that determine how much extra power a Pokemon has, compared to the baseline. The better the IVs, the more hp/attack/defence (CP) the pokemon will have, compared to another Pokemon of the same species & level.
